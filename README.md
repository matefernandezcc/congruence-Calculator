# [What is a Modular congruence equation?](https://www.intmath.com/blog/mathematics/how-to-solve-linear-congruences-12539)
Exactly! modular arithmetic.

Its a part of number theory, basically just an equation with the form Ax ≡ B (mod M)
where '≡' mean congruent, for example 4 is congruent to 2 because 2|4 thus 4 is divisible by 2.

A clock has numbers from 1 to 12, when you get past 12 you start again from 1, so its modular.
